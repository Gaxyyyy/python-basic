Question 1: Given an input in the form of a positive integer n,
write a function taking the positive integer as the only parameter,
and printing out a triangle-shaped pattern made of the star character (*). 
Here n specifies the number of rows in the pattern.
The number of stars in each row increases by 2 each time.
For example:
If n = 3, the output of the function is
  *
 ***
*****
If n = 4, the output:
   *
  ***
 *****
*******

Code prototype: StarTriangle.py

Hint: to print something without newline, use end='' parameter for python function print, for example, print('hello', end='')
