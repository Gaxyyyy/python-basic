Question 1: Given an input in the form of a positive integer n,
write a function taking the positive integer as the only parameter,
and printing out a triangle-shaped pattern made of the star character (*). 
Here n specifies the number of rows in the pattern.
The number of stars in each row increases by 2 each time.
For example:
If n = 3, the output of the function is
  *
 ***
*****
If n = 4, the output:
   *
  ***
 *****
*******

Hint: to print something without newline, use end='' parameter for python function print, for example, print('hello', end='')

Question 2：Given limit as a positive integer, write a function that return the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit. Obviously,
the function takes limit as the only parameter.
As an example, if limit=20, then it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20.

Question 3: Given n as a positive integer, write a founction that cycle through every number from 1 to n, and put the number into a list, if the number is divisible by 4, then instead of putting the number itself into list, it puts “Fizz” into it. If the number is divisible by 6, then instead of putting the number itself onto the list, it puts “Buzz” onto it. If the number is divisible by both 4 and 6, then it puts “FizzBuzz” onto it. If the number doesn’t satisfy any of these conditions, simply puts the number itself onto the list. The list will be the only return from the function.

For example: if n = 13, then the list returned from the function looks like: [1, 2, 3, Fizz, 5, Buzz, 7, Fizz, 9, 10, 11, FizzBuzz, 13]
